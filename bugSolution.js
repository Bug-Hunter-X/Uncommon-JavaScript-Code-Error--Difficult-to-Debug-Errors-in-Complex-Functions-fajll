// There is no specific code fix for this type of uncommon error.  The solution lies in employing better software development practices to prevent such errors from occurring in the first place.  The bug.js file showcases a simple example; the issue becomes apparent when you scale to larger and more complex applications.

// Recommended strategies for prevention:
// 1. Write modular code: Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable ones.
// 2. Implement comprehensive unit testing: Test each function individually to catch errors early.
// 3. Use a code linter: Tools like ESLint can detect potential issues and enforce coding style.
// 4. Conduct thorough code reviews: Have another developer review the code to identify any overlooked errors.
// 5. Employ debugging tools: Utilize browser developer tools or debuggers to step through code execution.
